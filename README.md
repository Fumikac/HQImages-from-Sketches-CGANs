# Generating High Quality Facial Images from Sketches Using Conditional GANs
[Final Report](final_report.pdf)

## Abstract
Generating photo-realistic facial images from hand-drawn sketches has been a problem of significant interest in the computer vision literature. Most approaches rely on using conditional GANs, with the best models requiring training using multiple GANs on
segmented inputs. We are interested in exploring how to generate high-quality images while reducing the computational complexity of the state-of-the-art models. To this end, we introduce using data augmentation with a variety of sketch generation and simplification methods. Our best model, trained using an augmented dataset of three different sketch types, produces significantly higher quality images than simply relying on one sketch generation method.
